<h1>Welcome to Unicornland!</h1>

ðŸ¦„ Unicornland is a practice Ruby on Rails project and Airbnb clone built â€” **in one week!** â€” during Le Wagon's Web Development program.

ðŸ¦„ We promise we know unicorns aren't real, but we were encouraged to pick a fantastical item to rent or sell, and thus Unicornland was born!

ðŸ¦„ Unicornland allows unicorn lovers all around the world to rent a unicorn for a week, filtering by color, gender, size and price.

ðŸ¦„ The application also allows unicorn owners to list their unicorns for rental: uploading a photo of their beloved one-horned horse and managing incoming reservations.
